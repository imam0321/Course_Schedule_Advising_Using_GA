# ABSTRACT
Course timetabling is one of the most important challenges affecting academic institutions
since it affects student learning and teachersâ€™ working schedules. This paper proposes an
approach using a genetic algorithm with focus on course timetable scheduling problem for
universities with several key constraints such as class sizes, class clashes, minimum required
attendance days per week, and reasonable time gaps in between lessons. The algorithm then
takes the preregistration data and the weekly pattern to progressively create and improve
schedules to reduce conflicts and penalties. Major goals include protocols that ensure no
student schedules overlap, each class is populated with between 20 and 35 students and there
is no significant break between different classes. Carrying out penalty functions, it is possible
to analyze the feasibility of the schedule in order to achieve the best results when optimizing
loads in different generations. The proposed approach is expected to eliminate unnecessary
man-made constraints in scheduling in order to foster efficient resource utilization in learners
practices.
